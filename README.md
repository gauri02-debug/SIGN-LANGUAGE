# SIGN-LANGUAGE

Developed a neural network-based system with the goal of accurately classifying American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet letters depicted in images of signing hands.
(Python, Neural Networks: Leveraged Python and neural network technologies to create a robust and precise classification model, facilitating effective communication for individuals using ASL. 
Implemented a robust testing framework to assess the neural networkâ€™s performance, fine-tuning it for optimal letter recognition.
